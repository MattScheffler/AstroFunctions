# AstroFunctions
Functions made for astrophysics calculations, plotting, data analysis, etc.

The goal is for all the individual function modules to be independent, with a main menu for linking them all conveniently if several are wanted to be used in a session.

AstroFunctionsMain.py is the main menu that handles user requests.
AstroFunctionsIndex.py is used to handle function calls, and adds a basic interface for working with them.
